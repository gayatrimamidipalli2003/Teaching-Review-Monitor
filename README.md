# Teaching-Review-Monitor
The "Faculty Feedback" system is a web application designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, and visualization of student feedback on faculty performance. Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), this system enables students to submit feedback for their professors on various parameters such as teaching effectiveness, course content, and overall satisfaction. The system also includes an authentication mechanism to ensure secure access for administrators who can view aggregated feedback and individual ratings. The project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for feedback collection and analysis, ultimately contributing to the improvement of teaching quality and student satisfaction.
